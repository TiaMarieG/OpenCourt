VITE_SERVER_HOST = "" # Server Host (VM's IP Address)

VITE_SERVER_PORT = "" # Server Port (3000)

- Install dependencies `npm i`
- Launch server `npm run dev`
- Access server at [host]:5173 (example: http://localhost:5173/)

## User Experience
User Flows: A user can either host or join an event. If they host an event, they will determine size of event, location, time, and what sport. If they are a participant they will review list of events and join the one they would want to partake in. If a user is hosting they can remove players they don't want. Users themselves can also leave event. Hosts can also delete events.
